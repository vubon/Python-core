"""
A return is recursive function/method for programming lanaguage.
Suppose f(x) = x + 3 then x = 5 then find the f(5) value of this function. So it is a function of mathematics problem.
Now let's solve this problem according to mathematics way.

Allright, f(x) = x + 3
=> f(5) = 5 + 3
=> f(5) = 8

So let's solve the math by computer.
"""
# First example.
#def function(x):
    #return x + 3
#print("Enter the x value: ")
#x = float(input("> "))
#print(function(x))

## Second example
for x in range(1,9):
    print(x)
